   .venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the backend server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
   ```

   The API server will be available at:  
   `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the React frontend:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Copy the contents of the `build/` directory into the backendâ€™s static directory:

   ```bash
   cp -r build/* ../static/
   ```

## Usage

- Open your browser and go to:  
  `http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/index.html`
